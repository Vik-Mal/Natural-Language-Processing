This project is based on reviewing restaurant as per by its customers.
Natural feedback can be very unstructured and to able to process the data in machine learning we need to clean it.
In our dataset we have 2 columns; 1st column represent 'Reviews' by customers and 2nd column represent a feedback in the form of 0 or 1,
where 0 means dislked and 1 means liked by a particular customer.
Also in this project 1000 reviews are included.
To clean the data python library regular expression is used.
